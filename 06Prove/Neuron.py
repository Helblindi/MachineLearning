This Weeks Assignment
1) Create some type of data structure to hold a node (a.k.a. neuron).

2) Store the set of input weights for each node.

3) Provide a way to create a layer of nodes of any number (this should be easily specified via a parameter).

4) Account for a bias input.

5) Be able to take input from a dataset instance (with an arbitrary number of attributes) and have each node produce an output (i.e., 0 or 1) according to its weights.

6) Be able to load and process at least the following two datasets:

    - Iris (You didn't think we could leave this out did you!)

    - Pima Indian Diabetes

7) You should appropriately normalize each data set.
